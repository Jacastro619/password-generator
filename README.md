## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site]()

In this password generator project, I was tasked with creating a function in an existing JavaScript file to provide functionality for the password generator app. The function I created is executed when the 'generate password' button is clicked. The password generator will then ask a series of questions to determine which characters the user would like the password generator to include. Once the password generator receives the responses, it will provide a password based on the accepted criteria of the user. The generated password will appear in the secure password box.

## Usage 

- The Generate Password button: Clicking the 'Generate Password' button will activate a series of questions to determin what you password will look like.
